### What Is This?

This is a project made by Anden Acitelli and Sri Uppalapati for ENGR 1281.02H in December of 2018. Code was done by Anden, documentation and all the other stuff was done by Sri. 

It is a text-based RPG featuring a robust combat system, player stats, and more, all implemented in C++ using lots of OOP. 

### How to Run

The "finished" version of the project was completed on the Proteus, which is a microcontroller specific to Ohio State. This is located in the "main_proteus.cpp" file. 

A relatively unfinished, pure CPP version of the game can be found in the "main_noproteus.cpp" file. This is likely missing several key features from the finished game. This is because we initially made the game in pure CPP because it was easier to debug, then ported it over once we had a mostly finished game. This mostly just involved replacing method calls and modifying the input system to facilitate touch. However, we changed up some things in the program, so the non-proteus version will likely be much different than the actual finished project.
